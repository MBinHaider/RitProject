# Fundamentals of Data Analytics - Project 1 (Fall 2024)

## Overview
This project aims to analyze the factors influencing the pricing of cars in the Middle East market for **BRIX Auto**, an automobile company looking to expand into the region. The project utilizes data analytics techniques to build and evaluate predictive models for car pricing.

---

## Problem Statement
**BRIX Auto** seeks insights into the factors affecting car prices in the Middle East market, as these may differ significantly from the US market. This analysis will help the company set up a manufacturing unit in the region and compete effectively with local counterparts.
